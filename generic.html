									<h2 id="Mylife">My Life</h2>
									<p>I was born in a hospital in Kyoto on May 27, 2002. Just before and after my birth, I spent some while time in Kyoto, my mother's hometown. Most of my life has been spent in a place called Amami Oshima in Kagoshima Prefecture. It is located between Kagoshima and Okinawa prefectures and is often mistaken for Okinawa. I went to school in Amami all the way from kindergarten to high school, and then moved to Tokyo last year when I became a SWU student.</p>

									<h2 id="Mypast">My Past Study Abroad</h2>
									<p>When I was in the second year of junior high school, I participated in an exchange program held by Amami City. I went to Texas, USA. I stayed with a host family for two weeks, and I really enjoyed going to school and spending time with my host family.</p>
									<p>I went to New York City in the United States during the winter vacation of my second year of high school. I was very nervous because I went alone, unlike the time I went to Texas. However, I was able to make friends from overseas who I met at the language school, and we went to Manhattan together a lot and had a very fun two weeks. It was a precious experience to be able to enjoy the United States during Christmas and New Year.</p>
